My expertise lies in analyzing, designing, documenting, specifying, testing, implementing, and evolving information systems to deliver secure and high-quality solutions. I approach problem-solving with a holistic perspective and focus on creating experiences that connect people and businesses. I specialize in simplifying complex problems and use a variety of tools to monitor, analyze, and identify incidents, errors, improvements, and fixes that keep systems and operations running smoothly. My strongest qualities are communication, empathy, curiosity, and quick learning. I have diverse experience in BaaS solutions, API integrations, data analysis, and full-stack development, and I am competent in all aspects of the software development lifecycle.
